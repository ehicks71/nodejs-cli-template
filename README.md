# Node JS CLI Tool Documentation

The Node JS CLI tool written in Node.js and uses the Commander.js and Chalk libraries.

## File: `index.js`

This is the main entry point of the application. It defines the CLI commands and their actions.

### Shebang

The file starts with `#!/usr/bin/env node`, which tells the system that this is a Node.js script.

### Module Imports

The script imports necessary modules:

- `child_process` for executing shell commands
- `commander` for handling command-line arguments
- `chalk` for colorizing console output

### Helper Function `executeCommand`

This function takes a command string as an argument, executes it using `execSync` from the `child_process` module, and logs the command output to the console. If an error occurs during command execution, it logs the error message and exits the process with a status code of 1.

### Commander.js `Command` Object

A new `Command` object is created using Commander.js. This object represents the main command of the CLI.

### Commands

You can have several Commands (like `help`, `development`) which are defined using the `.command()` method. Each command can have its own description, options, and action. The action is a function that gets executed when the command is called.

### Subcommands

For each command, subcommands can be defined. For example, under the `development` command, there could be subcommands like `setup`, `start`, `stop`, and `restart`.

### Options

The commands and subcommand can have options like `--verbose`. These options can be provided when calling the command, and their values are accessible in the `options` object in the action function.

### Command-line Argument Parsing

Finally, `program.parse(process.argv)` is called to parse the command-line arguments. This triggers the action of the corresponding command or subcommand.

## File: `package.json`

This file is used by npm to manage the project's dependencies and scripts. It includes:

- The project's name, version, and description
- The main entry point of the application (`index.js`)
- The `bin` field, which maps the command `nodejs-cli` to the `index.js` file
- The `scripts` field, which defines script commands that can be run with `npm run`
- The `dependencies` field, which lists the project's dependencies (in this case, `chalk` and `commander`)
